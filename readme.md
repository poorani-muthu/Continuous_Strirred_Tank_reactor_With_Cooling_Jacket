# 🌡️ CSTR with Cooling Jackets Repository 🌡️

Welcome to the **CSTR with Cooling Jackets** repository! Here, you'll find everything you need to simulate and control a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) equipped with cooling jackets. Ready to dive into the world of advanced thermal management? Let's go!

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains a collection of MATLAB files designed to help you simulate and control a CSTR with cooling jackets. Here’s a quick rundown of what each file does:

- `PID_CSTR.m`: Implements a PID controller for the CSTR.
- `SISO_CSTR.m`: Single Input Single Output model for the CSTR.
- `transfer_function.m`: Defines the transfer function of the system.
- `cstr_1.m`: Primary script for running the CSTR simulation.
- `state_space_matrix.m`: Defines the state-space representation of the system.

## ⚙️ How It Works

Our system involves:
- **Hot Stream Inlet**: Where the hot fluid enters.
- **Cold Stream Inlet**: Where the cold fluid enters.
- **Mixing Chamber**: The central area where temperatures blend.
- **Cooling Jackets**: Surround the CSTR to help manage and stabilize the temperature.
- **Outlet Stream**: Where the perfectly tempered fluid exits.

## 🔑 Key Parameters

Several critical parameters influence the system's performance:
- 🌡️ **Temperature of Hot Stream**
- 🌡️ **Temperature of Cold Stream**
- 🚰 **Flow Rates**
- 🛠️ **Mixing Chamber Design**
- 🧥 **Cooling Jacket Efficiency**
- 🎛️ **Control Mechanisms**

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with your thermal adventures:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/CSTR-with-cooling-jackets.git
   cd CSTR-with-cooling-jackets](https://github.com/poorani-muthu/Continuous_Strirred_Tank_reactor_With_Cooling_Jacket)
   ```
2. **Explore the Code**: Key files to look at:
   - `PID_CSTR.m`
   - `SISO_CSTR.m`
   - `transfer_function.m`
   - `cstr_1.m`
   - `state_space_matrix.m`

3. **Run the Simulation**:
   Open MATLAB and run the `cstr_1.m` script to start the simulation.

## 🔬 Experiment and Tweak

Feel free to adjust parameters, tweak designs, and experiment with different configurations. Want it hotter? Turn up the heat! Need it cooler? Let the cooling jackets do their job. This system is your thermal playground.
